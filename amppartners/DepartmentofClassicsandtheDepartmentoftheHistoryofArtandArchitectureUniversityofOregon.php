<!-- Article Text -->
The department of Classics at the University of Oregon has a flourishing undergraduate and graduate program. The field of classics embraces all aspects of Greek and Roman culture from the prehistoric to the medieval period. Through the study of classical literature in the original languages (ancient Greek and Latin) and in English translation, and through the study of other areas encompassed by the classics, such as ancient history, philosophy, art history, and archaeology, a student gains an understanding of the culture and ideals of the Greco-Roman world.ï¿½
