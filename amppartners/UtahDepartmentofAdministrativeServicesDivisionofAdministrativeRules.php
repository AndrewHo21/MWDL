In 1973, the Legislature passed the Utah Administrative Rule Making (sic) Act (Chapter 172, Laws of Utah 1973) and charged the State Archivist with the responsibility for receiving rule filings and publishing rules.</p>

In 1987, to further emphasize the importance of rulemaking and to secure funding for publication, the Legislature changed the 'Office' designation to 'Division'.
