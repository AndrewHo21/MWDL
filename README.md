# MWDL
This repository is a collection of scripts that I created when working at the University of Utah library. It holds scripts that are used to generate pages for the mwdl.org website and divide up google analytics reports into spreadsheets to be sent to the libraryâ€™s partner institutions.
mwdl.org is a non-profit website that organizes digital library collections from academic and private conservatory institutions across the Midwest.
