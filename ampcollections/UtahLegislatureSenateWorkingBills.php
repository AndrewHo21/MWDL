This series documents the legislative process in the Utah Senate. The working copy includes the bill as introduced and any amendments made to it. The final official version of the bill is not part of this series unless it was vetoed by the Governor, returned to the Legislature while still in session, and the Legislature failed to override the veto.</p>
