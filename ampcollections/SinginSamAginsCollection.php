The Agins family
<!-- Article Text -->
</p><br/>Singin Sam Agins (1919-1996) was passionate about writing, collecting, and recording American folk songs, especially of the West. He shared his joy of music for four decades (1940s+) by teaching and performing before audiences of dude ranch guests, hospital patients, disabled children, military vets, and even incarcerated prisoners.</p><br/>
