"</p><br/>The Wasmuth Portfolio was a collaborative effort between Frank Lloyd Wright and Ernst Wasmuth, a German publisher. It is a complete folio of Wright's work to date, and was published in 1910-11. The collection of Wright's houses and commercial buildings received far more attention and praise in Europe than in the United States. Contemporary architects called it ""the most important book of the century.""</p><br/>"
