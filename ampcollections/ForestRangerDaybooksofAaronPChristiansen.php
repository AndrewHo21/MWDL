<p>The fifteen daybooks in this collection describe the daily activities of a Forest Service Ranger in the early twentieth century. Written by Aaron Parley Christiansen when he was assistant Forest Ranger for the Uintah Forest, the daybooks cover 1915-1921 and describe his work activities in both the field and the office. Working in the Uintah National Forest, Christiansen was required to keep a daily log of his activities; these books represent that record. Subjects mentioned include timber sales, grazing leases, road building, forest fires and reseeding projects. Christiansen spent a great deal of his time in the field primarily working out of the Salt Creek Ranger Station; many of the entries concern the Salt Creek area. Of particular interest are the comments concerning Forest Service philosophy and Christiansen's philosophy about conservation. </p>
