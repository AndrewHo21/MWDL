A spectacular grotto in Glen Canyon of the Colorado River, Music Temple was a popular stop for parties of tourists. As early as the 1930s someone began the tradition of leaving a metal box in the grotto where travelers could write their names on notebooks and pieces of paper, many of which are a "who's who" of early river runners.</p>
