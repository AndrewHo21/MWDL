</p><br/>The Utah Territorial Statehouse State Park collection features over 900 photographs, letters, and ephemera from the museum's almost 5,000-object collection. Photographs are largely from family albums and were taken in the late 19th century, while others depict events, residents, and homes in the Fillmore area in the early- to mid-1900s.</p><br/>
