Charles S. Saladino II was a highly respected landscape architect who worked on several public service projects while also leading the fight to gain professional recognition for landscape architects. Saladino designed many notable projects, including Floyd Lamb Park (one of the largest state parks in Southern Nevada), for which he was awarded the Elmer H. Anderson Parks Excellence Award and the historic mall and Arboretum at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</p>
