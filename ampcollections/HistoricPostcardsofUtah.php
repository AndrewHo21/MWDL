Take a postcard tour of Utah's recent past, from beautiful Cache Valley in northern Utah, to the religious and historic sites of Salt Lake City, and on down to the unique rock formations of southern Utah. Dating mostly from the early to mid 1900s, these colorized, photographic, and linen postcards depict prominent buildings and important places, some of which have disappeared or been significantly altered. </p>
