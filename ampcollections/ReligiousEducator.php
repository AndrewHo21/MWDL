<!-- Article Text -->
</p><br/>The Religious Educator is a collection of papers published under the auspices of the Religious Studies Center at Brigham Young University. It is intended to provide insights for those involved in teaching the restored gospel of Jesus Christ at every level, from paid professionals to those who are called to teach in the branches and wards of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The beliefs of the respective authors are their own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of Religious Education, Brigham Young University, or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p><br/>
