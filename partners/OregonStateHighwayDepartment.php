<p>Maps are some of the most information-rich documents that we use to communicate to each other. They visually represent not only the physical terrain, but also our impact upon it. This online selection of maps from the Oregon State University and University of Oregon librariesï¿½ collections are but a small sample of what is available in either library. Please contact your local librarian for more information regarding these treasured Oregon collections.<br/>Thank you to the Oregon State Highway Department for permission to include their maps in this collection.</p>
